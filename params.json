We utilize a novel technique that leverages a ground truth floorplan and is capable of aligning panoramas with little to no overlap.\r\n\r\n# Abstract\r\n\r\nThis paper presents a novel algorithm that utilizes a 2D floorplan to\r\nalign panorama RGBD scans.\r\n\r\nWhile effective panorama RGBD alignment techniques exist, such a system\r\nrequires extremely dense RGBD image sampling. Our approach can\r\nsignificantly reduce the number of necessary scans with the aid of a\r\nfloorplan image. We formulate a novel Markov Random Field inference\r\nproblem as a scan placement over the floorplan, as opposed to the\r\nconventional scan-to-scan alignment. The technical contributions lie in\r\nmulti-modal image correspondence cues (between scans and schematic\r\nfloorplan) as well as a novel coverage potential avoiding an inherent\r\nstacking bias.  The proposed approach has been evaluated on five\r\nchallenging large indoor spaces. To the best of our knowledge, we\r\npresent the first effective system that utilizes a 2D floorplan image\r\nfor building-scale 3D pointcloud alignment. The source code and the data\r\nwill be shared with the community to further enhance indoor mapping\r\nresearch.",
